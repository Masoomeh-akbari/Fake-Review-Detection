# 🕵️ Fake Review Detection — Literature Review & Proposed Architecture

This project explores the growing issue of fake online reviews and investigates advanced machine learning and deep learning methods for effective detection. Through a comprehensive literature review, we examined traditional models (e.g., SVM, Naive Bayes) and modern deep learning approaches including **CNNs**, **RNNs**, and **GANs**.

Based on our findings, we propose a novel **hybrid deep learning architecture** that combines the strengths of multiple models to improve detection accuracy, robustness, and adaptability. While this is a theoretical study, the proposed design aims to guide future development and research in fake review detection.
